###### Read Me Assignment: Arman Güngör - 0947698



#### System, infrastructure, intervening, creativity, divert,


The home-work assignment that we got for one of the first lessons was to bring an observation tool. A tool what you use as an observation tool. So as a student in advertising I looked at the things I use to get inspired, work, search and correct. I could have gone with the easy stuf like my laptop, google or phone. But the thing that I started using since I started this bachelor and really helped me sharpen the idea and get rid of weaker ones is the permanent marker. The tool that diverts from the sketching and shows idea’s in their naked and visible form. Big, ugly and full of potential. “Idea’s arise from me. Are made big, bold and visible. I create inspiration and I am permanent”. I think the permanent marker has a lot of similarities with the advertiser. 

The lesson attached to the observational tool assignment was different to say lightly. What needed to happen was to really study your tool. Feel it, examine it, think about it and write everything down. Try to remember the tool from every possible angle. Now try to become the tool what would it think, do and feel. On the service it felt a little pointless and awkward. But if you really study something not a marker necessarily but anything in a way like this will give you some sort of idea that you would never get if you where using typical way of research. Likewise, the practice is called ”Hacking” and to hack something you will need to know the system from in and out. This is an interesting way of introducing this subject.

#### Documentation-Shailo:
This was a lecture about systems and how they can be hacked or hack themselves. When is something a hack and when is it a system on it’s own. For this lesson we got the assignment to go out and make pictures of different systems and networks that are organic, mechanical, social and technical. Following the documentation you would share the pictures in a group and debate on how you could hack some of these systems. The best one was chosen to present to the class. In short: "Everything can be hacked”.

 

#### The lecture of Florian Cramer:
The lecture of Florian was about the principles of hacking and how it has changed true time. they're where a lot of interesting insights and topics about Data, early hacking and hoaxes that expanded the idea of hacking. For example the Yesmen and Piratebay where mentioned, two subjects very familiar to me because of previous projects and interesting to view it from a hacking perspective. The whole lecture was a goldmine of nice insights and sources to use in my own project.

#### Sadly for the Vario exercise I was in Londen with an excursion from the advertising department.
This is what I understood:
Made 3 soups
hacking recepties
everyone tasted the first one -  chocolate and avocado in it
Hack in to the considerate level of the soup
Make it as considerate as possible
Changing the meaning of the soup



#### Respond to the questions: 
What is the context in which you operated? 
When I choose to do this practice it was not the usual conception of hacking where a boney gamer boy with glasses is sitting behind his computer in the dark hacking in to government systems. No I was really interested in hacking because of the artist Constant Dullaart and James Bridle. These two people where hacking in a more tangible way where they will study a topic or subject and create a genius hack for it. This is what james Bridle did with a project Autonomous Trap where James Bridle catches a self driving car by drawing a circle with dashed lines around it. In this way the car knew to go in to the circle but because the circle was whole in the middle it could not exit anymore. caught a self driving car! Projects like this define hacking in my opinion. 


#### What phy-gital (physical and/or digital) systems did you investigate?
Like I mentioned the projects of Constant Dullaart and James Bridle where a nice place to start from. projects like: https://imgur.com/a/7jlJeAb
- 100.000 Followers for Everyone
- Jennifer in Paradise
- Drone Shadow
- Watching the watchers
- Autonomous Trap
I also did some research in some great advertising like that from the agency KesselsKramer with their advertising for example the Hans Brinker Budget Hotel. A hack can just be a great idea to do something in a different or better way. This makes research al over the place and in some way really hard. It is like saying that you need to do your research about art. All of it. So rather than drowning in al the information, some light general research and sharp insights where the best way to go for the time we got. Also having a base of knowledge about the subject helps a lot.


#### What did you find? 
I would say that hacking can be everything. Because everything is in a system of some sort and could be intervened with. Where I would draw the line is when a hack is normalised, it is no longer a hack but just something that is part of the system. In order for it to be a hack it should divert in a new a new and meaningful way. So if you would look for example at birth control. It was a hack when it was just introduced, “hacking biology”, but because it is normalised and part of our western culture it is part of the system and no longer a hack. This manner could be utilised in what scale of system you want to.


#### What is your hacking method? 
The hack that the group and I came up with is a response to the crooked drugs legislation of the Netherlands and how it is dealt with. Party’s, Raves and festivals are built up to have the perfect drugs experience with ice cream, candy sellers. A place where water more expensive then beer but when you are caught with a few pills or a bag of something they take it, you are humiliated, send away and if they have a bad day criminalised. But this does not stop the usage of drugs we just hide it in our crotches or bra’s. Our hack will be a conversation piece and putting a statement against this ironic legislation by wearing the drugs open and proud like literal jewellery. Free, proud and self insured.


#### If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);
It would be pretty easy create jewellery from your drugs. Wear it like any other jewellery and together with other jewellery hiding it in plain side. The problem is when this hack will be known and the legislation still the same. Because then the guards will start looking for these kinds of trickery and the hack will be over. But I don’t think this hack is meant for just being a different way of smuggling drugs in to raves. It is meant to create a debate around this legislation and bring awareness to the stupidity of it.

Scamper behaviour
Scamper method:
SCAMPER was first introduced by Bob Eberle to address targeted questions that help solve problems or ignite creativity during brainstorming meetings. The nameSCAMPER is acronym for seven techniques; (S) substitute, (C) combine, (A) adapt, (M) modify, (P) put to another use, (E) eliminate and (R) reverse.

A system is a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole. A system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning.

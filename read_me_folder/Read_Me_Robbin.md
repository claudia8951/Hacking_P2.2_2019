We started of by introducing ourselves and thereby telling everyone what hacking means to you as a designer. Before we started, I was already thinking about this. The first thing that came to my mind when somebody mentioned hacking was the computer site hacking, like bank accounts. But when I began thinking about hacking in Spatial Design, I then quickly came up with the “life hacks” where you alter something, like a cabinet of IKEA.

In the lecture of Florian he began telling us about the history of hacking. I found it really difficult to listen to sometimes, but it really helped me see that that hacking is in fact a very broad subject. What I found very interesting is that there are two different types of hackers: Whited, someone who does good with their hacks, and blacked, someone who works destructively. 
Florian gave us some examples of hacks. Some of them I had heard before, but didn’t at that moment realize is was hacking.

After that we started the exercises with our observation tools: We were going to inspect our inspection tools. As a tool I brought clip on lenses for the camera of my phone. I brought that because I always find it interesting to look at things from different angles, very close by of deformed, because like that you sometimes find interesting things. By inspecting the lenses in class, I found out things I don’t always notice immediately. The closer I looked, the more I saw about the material, texture and assembly.

During the lesson of Joseph he told us about Chindogu, a Japanese “game” where people make up “useless” life hacks. Some of them are very funny, others just a bit stupid.  For his class we also had to bring 11 pictures of our body. Then we got the assignment to hack our own bodies. Together with Beyza I decided that we could merge our bodies together. Partly because our pictures couldn’t make up a whole human again, and partly because we decided to hack our bodies even further, to build them up out of two already existing systems. Here I started to see that you can take existing “ingredients” and mash them up to create something new, and that’s also part of hacking for me.

The workshop at Varia from Niek felt a bit connected to the lessong of Joseph for me. This time with actual ingredients. For the workshop we all had to bring an “ingredient”. It wasn’t specified what we were going to use it for, so everyone brought very random stuff. At Varia we found out that we were going to make a Potluck Soup, where everyone brings something and you put it all together for one big meal. I found this part a bit difficult, because we were waisting so much food that could have been eaten on it’s own, by putting things like onion, chocolate, tangerine, cucumber and jelly together. 

After the Potluck Soup exercise, we were given a recipe for soup, that we needed to hack into a more considerate meal. We took a lot of different factors into account, like allergies, religion, proces, industry, transport, etc. We changed the recipe so it had fewer ingredients, no processed herbs, no dairy and no meat, so it would be suitable for almost everybody. It was very informative to take a deep look and really think about where all your food is from.

In the workshop of Joana at Varia we first did a few body movement exercises. The exercises were accompanied with sound, that kept going faster and faster. What I found very interesting is that you would expect the people to keep moving faster and faster. But the sound had absolutely no influence on what we were doing. I think that’s because we all knew it was about hacking, and so subconsciously we didn’t listen to the sound.

After our body exercises we went back to our groups and got explanation about different kinds of programming. For me that part of the lesson was hard. I didn’t really understand and I still don’t really get it. After the explanation, we made an choreograph of objects we brought. We went with a “power of language” theme. We gave a non living object a life.

The next lesson was a workshop with Shailoh. We talked about the purpose of hacking, and what kind of “line” there is between hacking and “normal” things. We came to the conclusion that that line really depends on the context, but, as soon as something gets “normalized” it isn’t hacking anymore. We took a look at the SCAMPER method, which is an organized way to think outside the box.

We also talked about the fact that some things are just so set in stone, that we don’t think about them anymore. We don’t question why those things are the way they are. For me this was almost an eye opener, because I have never thought about that and that kind of amazed me. Also we came to the realization that almost everything is part of a system, and that system is probably a part of another system, which makes almost everything connected. 

There are a few questions you can ask yourself when you are working on connections. Can you undo the connection without damage or influence? What kind of quality does the connection have? What goes in and out? How many connections can something support and what is the tipping point? What kind of connection is it? Most of the time when something connects, it also divides / disconnects something else, like train-tracks and veins.

We went around the academy to look for different kinds of connections and then talked about them in class. There are mechanical connections, social, organic, electrical, wave, magnetic. Probably even more, and I learned a lot by deeply looking, and again saw things I wasn’t used to seeing. The most special thing I learned here was how pin cards work with the magnetic NFC system, that gives the card just enough energy to give out the right information. I never thought about how pin cards work, but this actually blew my mind.

# the project #

In the beginning I had an quick brain wave, were I thought about changing the library from alphabetical to colour organized, for people who think in images and can’t remember the name, but do remember what the book looks like. I didn’t do this because it’s an destructive way of hacking, because after that either I or someone else should put it back in place, and that’s an awful amount of work.

Because we were with two spatial designers in our group, we proposed the idea to do something spatial, because in the short projects of the practices most of the time that is impossible due to time limits and the spatial designer being on their own. The whole group seemed enthusiastic about this idea, and we all took the weekend to think about a spatial subject we could possibly hack, and that we found interesting. The Monday after that we met, all showed our proposal and then voted for the “best” one.

The first time I proposed a plan I had the idea to take the idea of an escape room, and hack that into a break in room. You could put something in the middle that people would want to get to, and they would have to do all the tasks and solve the riddles to get there, making whatever that’s inside very special. I thought about the MC Slotervaart hospital in Amsterdam, which is a plus shaped building, with 4 “wings”. You could put 4 different functions in each part of the building, like maybe an hotel, a bar, a spa and a restaurant.

There were also a lot of other very cool ideas, like changing a library into more of a theme park, with different sections depending on the topic of the books. I won’t put them all in here because I suppose everyone of our group is going to tell about the idea they proposed.

We managed to easily pick one, but, after meeting with Shailoh came to the conclusion that none of our ideas were good for this project because we needed to do the hack in real life. Changing a literal space completely in a week seemed a bit to enthusiastic, so we dropped the spatial part and all began to brainstorm again. It needed to be something we could observe first, do some research and analyze.

After that I came up with the idea to hack a parking garage. The parking garage is, I think, quite a clear system. You have an empty parking garage, and people put their cars in there, resulting in the garage getting fuller. This is an input and an output. The only difference here is that there is free will of the people who are in the cars, because they decide where they want to park their cars. I was thinking we could observe how the garage fills up during the day, which spots are full the quickest, etc. After that we could try to hack the users into a different order of filling up the spots. We could have done that by hanging some danger ribbon from the ceiling, so people could still use the spot, but maybe wouldn’t because of the ribbon hanging there.

I found it very difficult to think of a system that we could observe and analyze, without thinking about the hack we could possibly do beforehand. After meeting again everyone in our group seemed to have that problem. There were some “semi” idea’s, so we merged two together into the one we are doing now. 

As a system we picked the streets around the Willem de Kooning. The input of this system is the city and the surroundings, and the output is the behavior of people in the system. The way they walk, how they feel, etc. After we picked our subject we all got busy doing research, and found that maybe we have driven to far away from a system. We talked about it but came to the conclusion no one had an better idea to work on, especially with only 1 week left. So we decided to go with it and see if we can work with this. 

We made an shared Google drive folder, where we gathered all our research. (I did not include our research in this read me file. If you want it, we can share the google drive folder with you as well) Some of us researched the mental part of feeling unsafe on the streets, others researched graffiti and I researched the sizes of sidewalks. I looked at how they are meant to be, why, and what happens when the streets don’t follow the “norm”. I really imagined some of the streets to be to small, but I found out they are actually all okay. I also looked at some documents of the municipality of Rotterdam, where they explain how streets should be in different types of areas.

What we are trying to do with our hack is make people more aware of the “dangerous” part’s of the area, by creating a map. For our hack we are going to put up all kinds of lights in one place, to make it feel less dangerous and more visible. So it’s more of a mental model that we are trying to hack here, we are trying to hack people into thinking they are safer in a place where they wouldn’t feel so safe without our hack.

Our tools are extremely limited an biased, because we didn’t go into asking the people who walk around in the area a lot, except for ourselves. So even though we are focussing on people here, we didn’t use people for our research. Which, looking back, is quite stupid. If I were to do this exact project again, I would start by asking people in the neighborhood how they feel, and what they feel like that are the dangerous areas. 

Also, I’m still not sure if what we did here is actually hacking, and if we took a good enough of a system. If I would have done this project on my own I would have picked the parking garage, because of that I’m quite sure that that is a proper system.

# my thoughts #

What I learned most in this practice is all the different ways I can use to gain a broader perspective on something. I usually already saw things in quite a broad view, but I came to the realization that I can make that even more broad. I gained a higher sensitivity for even more details, most in the ways how something work and how I could possibly change that in more ways then I used to see.

The most interesting part about this course for me was the part where we took known ingredients, and hacked those to create something different, like the lesson of Niek at Varia and the lesson of Joseph. That is something I can also use in my own major, Spatial Design. 

I also came to the realization that a part of Spatial Design that I’m interested in, tiny housing etc., has quite some overlapping with Hacking. 
For example, in tiny houses we kind of hack all the functions as we know them. You make the toilet in such a way that you can also shower in there. The bed is also meant as a couch and the stairs are also used for storage. Things are used multi functionally and use stuff differently than what they are originally made for.

In the summer I’m going to work on extra work for my portfolio. I already had some ideas for this, but after this hacking course I’m definitely going to take the idea of a house with all it’s ingredients and hack that in something that’s still a house but different. 

I found an example of this: It’s called “de hub” and it’s a modular living system that you can place in any building and has all the facilities you need to live inside. It’s made by the Rotterdam based architecture firm Kraaijvanger. When I found this I immediately saved it in a list of cool projects that I can someday use as an inspiration point. 

What I also found was that the core of hacking, for me, was to find something that already exist, and change that into something better or different. When I began to think about that, I think that that also is the core of design for me, apart from the fact that that’s the core of hacking. I think in a lot of things you do when you are designing is you take something that is already existing and change it in the way you find “right” or “better”.

What I brought as an example for hacking for the first lesson was an IKEA hack, where you use something you can buy at IKEA and upgrade this to your liking. It was the first thing that came to my mind when thinking of hacking, and now, after this course I still think this is a great example. It’s something that I see happening a lot in my major and that I would like to do once for myself. I think when are designing and you take a look at things that already exist, and try to use that for your design you sometimes end up with great projects.

Still, I think that for my minor in the third year I won’t choose hacking. Some parts of it, like described in the rest of this read-me file, I surely will take with me, because I found them super interesting and informative. Overall, I think my mind doesn’t work the way it should to become a proper hacker. I enjoyed parts of this project, but I found that while I was working on our assignments, I wasn’t really enjoying myself the way I am while working on something of my own major.
In the big group (not my own small group) I found myself listening to the conversations that were going on, while I wasn’t eager to join the conversations and for me that’s a clear pointer that this isn’t the right thing for me to do in the future.

# A list of quotes / words / references I find interesting regarding to hacking # 

“Hacken is het vinden van toepassingen die niet door de maker van het middel bedoeld zijn” = hacking is finding applications that are not intended by the creator of the appliance. https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacken 

There are also a lot of projects where they take an already existing building, like an old school, and old office building, and old hospital and turn it into student housing, or a hostel or other living possibilities. Nowadays it is becoming quite popular to turn old buildings that weren’t used for living into a living place, for example churches. They take buildings with clear functions and turn them into clear other functions.

This is an project close to where I live, were they took an old post office and turned it into a café-restaurant.  https://www.regioinbedrijf.nl/projecten/technico-werkte-mee-aan-nieuwe-functie-postkantoor-goes.4673/ 

This is an theme park that they build into an nuclear power plant that has never been used.  https://www.pretparkenduitsland.nl/wunderland-kalkar-en-kernies-wunderland 

There is a project in Rotterdam where one of my uncles live, where they took an old school building and turned them into apartments. https://www.rotterdamarchitectuurprijs.nl/2016/schoolwoningen-duyststraat.html 

And here they turned a house into a museum https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceland_(landgoed) 

Other than the hacks I already mentioned I had trouble finding things related to Spatial Design. I have looked for references, reference projects, quotes, anything. I can’t find it and I actually also can’t think of it, other than everything else I already mentioned here or am going to mention. I don’t quite get how hacking fits in Spatial Design, and that is connected to the conclusion I made that Hacking isn’t the right way for me to go in.

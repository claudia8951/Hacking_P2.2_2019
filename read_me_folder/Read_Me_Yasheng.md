## **What is Hacking?**
**The example: Flash mode** 
<br> A flash mob is a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, perform an unusual and seemingly pointless act for a brief time, then quickly disperse, often for the purposes of entertainment, satire, and artistic expression. Flash mobs are organized via telecommunications, social media, or viral emails.

**More precise example:Square-dancing granny**
<br> In China, square dancing or plaza dancing is an exercise routine performed to music in squares, plazas or parks of the nation's cities. It is popular with middle-aged and retired women who have been referred to as "dancing grannies" in the English-language media. Due to its low cost and ease of participation, it has been estimated to have over 100 million practitioners.
<br>The groups congregate in the early morning and evening, any time of year, at parks or public squares, or anywhere they can find enough space, regardless of what other use that space may nominally have, such as a parking lot.  In the evening they tend to start dancing after dinner.
<br> Bascially, these dancing grannies hack squares near home as dancing places, hacking their peers to join and hack people passing by.

## **An Inspection Tool / Notes for Joana**
Methodology
Choreography
### Individual:
My object is a clip, which is always in my pencil case. It’s used to clip of course. Mostly, I use it to arrange my losing notes, but it’s also used to connect random things or fix things by binding two or more things together. Moreover, I unconsciously clip and unclip it as a behavior.
It’s golden and has a geometric shape. I like just watching it.

To which context:
For me, I am used to writing an idea, a note, an inspiration flash on random things. The clip helps to organize them to make sure I wouldn’t miss any important notes.
I like doing the organization of various thoughts in my head. The clip is like a mental behavior reification, which connects every piece into a complete logic ring.

glossary:
I am also connected, bound to something. I feel I am over touched and opened, closed all the time. Stop stretching me!

members:
rope, folder, file, stapler, box, pen, case, wire

reflect:
I sometimes also use it as a decoration. 
I look at it from different angles. I put it on the table, on my hand and put it with paper. 
I can also use types, folders, or always bring my notebook. But the clip is still the most convenient.

### From another member Phone:
The phone has already become something everyone takes with every day. There are so many apps inside, which allow people to do anything, calls, documentation, calculation, play games, watch videos, almost everything. And use the phone in every context.

To which context:
I guess the phone is mostly used to record, including photos, audios, videos, texts as an inspection tool. 

glossary:
scroll, click, tap, move, focus, search, charge, delete, in a pocket and out, connect, wifi !!! Bluetooth, earphone

members:
computer, internet, Ipad, camera

reflect:
It can also be used to beat something or cover something. An Ipad or a computer can replace the phone, but not that portable.

## **Summary for Varia**
It's about food hacking. We made two soups.
Firstly, we made a soup that other people don't know what put in.
The idea behind it is more about thinking about the products and combing something.
Secondly, we hacked a soup recipe and made a soup which everyone would like according to the recipe.

## **Final Hacking**
<br>We are inspecting the system of Private Art Collection.
<br>We are going to intervene this system by modifying/interpreting an artwork in different places/media/ways.
<br>We are hacking the asepct of private ownership of artworks by dragging it from private to public.
<br>Hacking could be used as a manifesto.
<br>Hacking is alternative perspectives of existing usages or aspects of systems.
<br>**What We Hack?**

<br>2. the private ownership
<br>3. the senses of audience
<br>a.hearing
<br>b.tasting
<br>c.smelling

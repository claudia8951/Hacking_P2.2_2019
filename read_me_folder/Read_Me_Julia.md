Check list for the Read_Me file:

1) select a list of keywords/ glossary about what Hacking is/ can be (tip: re-read the manifesto);
2) write down a reflection paragraph on the observational tool exercises (tip: you can link to images/ drawings);
3) grow the keywords/ glossary about what Hacking (tip: add your own references);
4) gather documentation on the two sessions with Shailoh and Joana;
5) write a summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer;
6) write a summary on the exercise you developed at Varia;
7) revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' (Respond to the questions: What is the context in which you operated? What phygical systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method? If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);

## Introduction class Shailoh and Joana

This first lesson was about what we think hacking is, what hacking means to us, and how broad the term actually is. Anatomy appeared to be **the** key-element of hacking;

### Anatomy
= core concept for approaching hacking
*study of the structure of internal workings of something*
you cannot study anatomy without cutting something open, without intervening – similar to hacking

Connected to the body; **‘organ’** is mother-word for organisation

Differences between ‘making’ and ‘hacking’
You make something that doesn’t exist yet, but when you hack you change something that’s already there. But are we really making new things? We make things with the tools and things that are there already… so do we make or hack?

| To make: | To hack: | 
| --- | --- | 
| -	Assemble | -	Break into something
| -	Create               | -	Ways to understand
| -	Put things together  | -	Joke / prank

    “The creation of new and useful knowledge is innovation. [...] Knowledge - the output of human innovation -
    is unique amoung all other resources.   
    It's not a physical resource. [...] A wheel may break or wear out, but the idea of the wheel 
    will keep on working.” 
    -Ramez Naam, 2013   

Choreography – define movement (outside of dance aswell)
- Dance
- Organisational tool 
- Artificially

_'Choreo-graphic' -> critically engaging_

	“Choreography has become a metaphor for dynamic constellations of any kind. 
	Consciously choreographed or not, self-organising or artificially constructed (…)”


### Manifesto

**Conscience of a Hacker**

It’s one of the first hacking manifesto’s, written in 1986

kid that got arrested —> against the system —> a bit of a very subjective autobiography (like an angry tumblr post) —> kind of hate the world/self righteous —> becomes a hacker

	- alike: crowds, people belonging together, positive and negative meaning
	- problems of the time he lived in

- virtuality
- ownership
- abstraction
- new possibilities

- cyberfeminst
- anti-establishment
- education
- collaboration
- accountability


**THE CRITICAL ENGINEERING MANIFESTO**

- transformative
- repurposing
- tech is both a challenge and threat
- raises awareness
- different discipline
- exploitation/sabotage
- hacking goes beyond limits
- freedom



**THE XENOFEMINIST MANIFESTO:**

Feminists talking about the future of feminists. ‘Against nature itself’ – fields of science and tech more inclusive for women. Want to see more inclusiveness

-	feminism
-	naturalism
-	emancipation
-	techno-science
-	patriarchy 


## Notes on Florian Kramer (15-05)

properties of hacking:

| **Open access** | **Jargon** | **Playing with systems** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| info/knowledge that you create can be shared openly | terminology/slang (which we will try to unpack) | the inspecting and experimenting with systems with or without ‘breaking’ them |

	The hacker attitude is to say that something IS possible, instead of not possible.

**Given examples:**
_Blue Box_
A good example of accidental hacking is the Capn Crunch whistle. This whistle came as a toy in a cereal box, and it was discovered that the frequences of the sound could be used to hack the telephone system --> this evolved into “blue boxes” — little circuits to generate this tone and outsmart the phones, built by Steve Wozniak, one of Apple's founders. 

_Chaos Computer Club_
This men-only (geek) hacker club wouldn't accept Cornelia Sollfrank (woman and ártist) so she hacked them by thinking of a blind-spot of men: they don't know a lot about the female body, fertility and periods. A contraception-computer would do the trick; at a convention this device was dropped and showed up on the Club its website questioning the purpose of the device. By doing this she pointed out that there are still things unknown to this club and that any other member can contribute valuable knowledge to their organisation.


Hacker jargon file:
1 person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities
_E.g. Food station at school: Eating as a part of the academy instead of a service / 'together’ / Food culture as a domain that can be put in the academy_
6 hacker can also be an expert or an enthusiast of any kinds, (.e.g an astronomy expert can also be a hacker (geek, nerd))
7 one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations
8 [deprecated] a malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by picking around

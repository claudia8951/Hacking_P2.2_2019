#### Tool
The most intersting about the observational tool exercise was that I found out things I didn't know. 
My tool was key, wich have multiple things you can use them for. Opening doors, obviously. 
But also cutting, stabbing, and the keychain was for recognizability. After the exercise with closing your eyes I forgot a lot of thing.
Like that keys make a lot of sounds, are cold and that keys are a very messy object.

#### Shailoh and Joana.
The first one was about manuscripts and what they told us about hacking. 
    For me the most intresting was that boy who just ranted about others being less good and he was amazing.
    A manuscript can be many things and many things can be a manusctript. Just like the term 'paper'
The second was about learning about you obervation tool.
    You can see this coming but it was funny to see that your 'inspaction tool' has way more functions than you think. 

#### Florian Cramer
The hacking lecture by Florian Cramer was essencial for me understanding hacking. First I couldn't really keep up with what he was saying due to different terms.
But later he showed examples of the first hackers (model train), the cap'n crunch whisle, karagarga, etc. 
It made me realize that its super broad, the meaning hacking, and what it could be. He also told us about monoskop and ubuweb.

#### VARIA
The workshop at varia was nice because it was very litteral. You can explain how to hack food and move on.
But this time we also acutally did it. This way you can learn what can go wrong, see the detailss and the effects of your hack.
And due to the fact that we took the time it sticks better in your memory so I won't forget this.

I found the body realization exercise a bit difficult as i somethimes don't take is seriousely enough.
We also had to walk and keep evenly space between us. There was also a sound that went faster and faster.
But I could already sense that the teacher wanted/hoped we would walk faster without realizing it was due to the sound.
And so for that, I didn't do it. She wanted to hack us but we hacked her back I think.

	our project
	
We were intrested in the system of the area around our school.
As we sometimes don't feel safe around our school or didn't know much about it.
So we made a doc on drive and everyone started doing researcht in:
what makes something dangerous, what are the laws of streets, what are the most populair streets, how do the streests look, etc.
Then we started browsing idea's about how to hack the way of how people feel and walk around those areas. 
We desided we wanted to make people feel safer around a certain area (wich we chose after researching)
First making a map pointing out the 'scary' places and what to expect there
And creating more light around no the place that is next to the water, very small path and surrounded by construction.
So that in the night it is safer and better to walk there.

#### What if 
I would continue with this project in my own major illustration.
For firsts I will research more for myself in so I get a better grasph of the situation.
If I let my mind go wild I would maybe illustarte on those 'scary' places by making a wallpainting, projection, etc. 
That way people wil want to come there out of curiosity and that will change the whole perspective. 
They won't think about the fact that it could be scary but just want to look and continue with their lifes

#### What I take with me
Hacking is something that never occured to me. 
I did do some programming for a game and robot-thingie do I thought it would have to do something with that. 
It is the opposite. 
The meaning of hacking is something you can philosophy about for a long time. 
For me, what I took, is this:
For firsts, you can find in almost anything a system. And that system can be changed. First you need to know how it works and that alone is way more intresting what I knew. 
The way not a lot of things are spontaneous and that there is a rhythm.
Just that realisation is the biggest inpact for me this parctise. It's fun. And in the future I will also see something in a different way, that you can change any system by hacking it. 
And changing that system, so it isn't working like the system, is hacking.

And when it is hacking is the big question.

o change the visual representatino, how, figure that out
o what did hacking bring you and what will you use it for in the future

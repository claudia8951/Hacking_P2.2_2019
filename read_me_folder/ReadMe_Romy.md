Checklist Hacking
1. select a list of keywords/ glossary about what Hacking is/ can be (tip: re-read the manifesto);
2. write down a reflection paragraph on the observational tool exercises (tip: you can link to images/ drawings);
3. grow the keywords/ glossary about what Hacking (tip: add your own references);
4. gather documentation on the two sessions with Shailoh and Joana;
5. write a summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer;
6. write a summary on the exercise you developed at Varia;
7. revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' (Respond to the questions: What is the context in which you operated? What phygical systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method? If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/based?)

# Collection of keywords that define/can be 'Hacking'

- Seeing beyond existing connections and possibilities
- Interfering in systems
- The 'SCAMPER' method
- Questioning ownership
- Exploring the borders, see how far it can go
- Anatomie

Self added references:
 
- The Interventionists Users' Manual for the Creative Disruption of Everyday Life, a book I discovered a few years ago, while finding out about postmortal photography
- Hacking clothes/wearables (example: Prada made a swimsuit that's not supposed to be used for actual swimming)
- Better a good steal than a bad creation

# MONDAY 13th May
Class with Shailoh and Joana

The practice started with a detailed schedule and planning in GitHub that was sent to us by mail. I appreciated this, because (what I didn't know then) it was the tool we would be working with ourselves, a gentle way to introduce us to GitHub.
Not only did it show what was expected from us, but also what we could be expecting from te practice.
For the first class it already told us to introduce ourselves through a component that 'constituted' us, and come up with a hacking-reference.

The component that constitutes me, or actually completely does NOT, is verbal communication. It has always been a struggle for me to find the right words, to talk loudly, to show confidence and show off what I can do and know. I always prefer other ways of sharing my knowlegde, because I often seem to be lost when in my mind it's all there.

I found it hard to come up with a hack. Because it was our first meeting, I wasn't sure what to expect and in what direction I was supposed to be thinking. The thing that popped up was my boyfriend, who always makes systems* out of things that have another purpose. For example: He once made a 'hand stabiliser' for his camera, by using a potato peeler as a handle and moving mechanism. I thought hat was an absolutely amazing hack.

After the joint introduction, Shailoh and Joana introduced us to their connection to hacking. I had, and still have a bit of a hard time to understand Joana's work. It seems to me like she is very much into coding and digital hacking, which I do not have or feel any shared interest in. Shailoh seemed more into the understanding of systems, how things can be viewed from different persectives in order to find possible hacks. That is what I expected and hoped for, when I applied for this class.
At the end of this day I got a bit lost for directions, but the next day fixed it all for me.

Also the Hackers' Manifesto was very helpful for me in order to understand the principles of hacking.

- Introduced ourselves through a hacking reference
- Introduction Shailoh and Joana
- Read A HACKER MANIFESTO, 'Manifestation & Hacking'and defining the text through 5 words:
> abstraction
> representation
> identity
> ownership
> virtuality

# WEDNESDAY 15th May
Lecture with Florian Cramer and exercises with Shailoh and Joana

Florian is a great teacher, if u'd ask me. He really cares about what he stands for and less about the rules and ways things are 'supposed' to be. In my dummy I made so many notes that I can't tell what hit me the most. Of course it was exciting that he gave us an insight of the illegal activities that a big part of hacking also consists of. What really intregues me was his ability to make these illegal activities seem legal, accessible and even 'fair'. In a way he hacked our minds, because we all know very well certain things are unacceptable, but he mastered the way of speaking and almost infiltrating in our minds, to make us doubt the damage these tings do.

He also really interacted with us and listened to what we had to say, ask and use it to go somewhere.
To me, his lecture was very useful in a way that the examples weren't the main information that helped me, but his lecture in general gave me a boost.

- A lecture on the history of hacking by Florian Cramer.
- A presentation with some core concepts and references: Inspecting & Intervening Phygital Anatomies (physical and digital)
- Warming up exercise with our brought inspection tool
- Formed a group for the project with Malou (Product Design), Steffie (Product Design), Oriane (Graphic Design) and me, Romy (Fine Arts & Teacher Training).

# Reflection on the observational tool exercises

First of all, I think it's too bad that the scan I made of the notes in my dummy is so zoomed-in that you can't really see it as it's supposed to be immediately. Possibly my GitHub skills are to be blammed for this.
The exercise made me feel and experience what the presentation was saying. The exercise was accessible and easy, but to be executed well in order to understand the concept. 

You can read all my findings in the notes, but something that got my attention was the 'MADE IN CHINA' printed on the tool I had. There was more information but this particular information was printed in the largest font, as if it was the most important. While it actualy had notinh to do with the inspection tool itself, in any way. 
It also had a magnet to help the functionality, which I don't think I would have noticed if I had just used it.

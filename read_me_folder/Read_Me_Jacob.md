## :checkered_flag:  Checklist  :checkered_flag:


- [x] select a list of keywords/ glossary about what Hacking is/ can be (tip: re-read the manifesto);

- [x] write down a reflection paragraph on the observational tool exercises (tip: you can link to images/ drawings);

- [x] grow the keywords/ glossary about what Hacking (tip: add your own references);

- [ ] gather documentation on the two sessions with Shailoh and Joana;

- [ ] write a summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer;

- [ ] write a summary on the exercise you developed at Varia;

- [ ] revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' (Respond to the questions: What is the context in which you operated? What phy-gital (physical and/or digital) systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method? If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);

## :scissors: Observational Tool Reflection :crystal_ball:
#### _Paper Scissors_

###### Performance
Separation, destruction, dissection, multiplication, reproduction, finesse, precision, calculation.
###### Context
Targeted task, crafts and creativity. To change the physical nature of your medium, or the perception.
###### The Point of View


_Consumption of others_

_Utilization is sustenance_

_Balance and contrast_

_The safety and the danger: weighted equally_ 

_Yin and Yang_

_Each side now separated_

_A rule of two's: two legs, two hands_ 

_Diverse yet familiar, interchangeable but not the same_

_The legs form the mouth_

_They provide locomotion of the task_

_Mirrors of each other_ 

_Centered on a fulcrum, tipping back and forth rythmically_

_It is a pleasure to serve a purpose_


###### Reflection
The flashing was a good breakdown of the object's form, disassociating myself from its purpose and viewing its shapes and silhouettes. With my eyes closed, it became personal. I explored the weight and texture, and how it felt to use it. It provided the set up for the point of view. The context allowed for brainstorming alternative uses. The point of view was very valuable. Giving the object a personality and background created a thread to follow in terms of language and meaning of the object beyonds its rudimentary function.

#### _Anatomical Anatomic Drawing Lessons_

After some warm-up exercises, I came up with two simple hacks using the automatic doors as a mechanical tool.

<a href="https://imgflip.com/gif/32n7y3"><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/32n7y3.gif" title="made at imgflip.com"/></a>

Once I printed my body, I decided to explore ways to recreate my identity using my own body, collaging myself into a new living being.

This instigated the thought process for me in terms of the group hack, relating to both collaborating with technology, and reinventing identity. It also led me to introduce the idea of using actual face masks and facial recognition software.

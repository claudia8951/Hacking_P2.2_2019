It’s one of the first hacking manifesto’s

Summary of the lecture of Florian Cramer**


There are three main characteristics of hacker culture:

Open access
info/knowledge that you create can be shared openly

Jargon
We’ll encounter a lot of terminology/slang which we will try to unpack

playing with systems
the inspecting and experimenting with systems with or without ‘breaking’ them



The hacker attitude is to say that something IS possible, instead of not possible.


Hacking often happens by accident. A good example of accidental hacking is the Capn Crunch whistle. This whistle came as a toy in a cereal box, and it was discovered that it could be blown into a phone to get a free phone call.
 —> this evolved into “blue boxes” — little circuits to generate this tone and outsmart the phones.
eventually this hack evolved into a subculture with its own zine.



A lot of hacking culture turns into activist culture. 
A good example of this is Bitcoin. This sprung out of hacker culture; originally it was a way to avoid the standard way of paying.
Another example is the one of Cornelia Sollfrank. She did an intervention at Chaos Computer Club, a hacker club that held conventions and that, at first, only accepted men. 
Cornelia hacked them by thinking about their blind spot — since it was a group of men, they’d never seen the device she hacked with because it was a machine that determined your fertility days. By doing this she pointed out that there are still things unknown to this club and that any other member can contribute valuable knowledge to their organisation. 


**Introduction class of Shailoh and Joana**

This first lesson took into account what hacking actually means for us, and how broad the term is. An important term was anatomy.

**Anatomy:** structure of something, learning about a system before breaking into it, just like surgeons do. 

but also;

To make: put together, asseble, embody, shape form…

to hack: is more about taking an existing thing and altering it, without destroying it.

“…. a wheel may break or wear out, but the idea of the wheel will keep working.” - Ramez Naam

“Choreography has become a metaphor for dynamic constellations of any kind. Consciously choreographed or not, self-organising or artificially constructed (…)”




**Observational tool excercise: a reflection**

The inspection tool I brought to class was a little tea spoon. I use these for a lot of different purposes in the kitchen. We looked at the affordances of the tool (for ex. to taste with, throw, break, transport with, stir with, poke with…). We also looked at the tool from our own point of view and then from the tool’s point of view. 
The change of perspective was very intriguing to me, because when I started thinking from the spoon’s point of view I started thinking about it in a way I had not done before. I think that this shift in thinking is crucial to be a successful hacker, because in order to hack a system you need to be able think from inside the system.

Teaspoon

Affordances: to taste with, to throw, break, pour, transport with, carry it with me, using it as a catapult, make noise with, stir, poke, make holes with, remove something from a substanc
Alike creatures: fork, knife, kitchen utilities
Spoon’s point of view: “I’m always dipped into substances, mostly food, but also dirt or other random things. I fall to the floor often because I’m very small. I get lost in the dishwasher easily. There’s almost nothing that’s smaller than me in the drawer that I’m kept in.
methods of observation used: looking, feeling, imagining, seeing the spoon in it’s “natural habitat” but also outside of it

Iphone
Affordances: photograph, write in it, communicate in lots of ways, document, explore with, measure with, gain knowledge about things, to throw it
Alike creatures: computer, tv, radar (anything that sends out a 
Phone’s point of view: “I’m always carried in someones hand, left everywhere, and I seldomly get cleaned, so there are lots of bacteria on my surface. I get used for an endless amount of things and I am usually unmissable in someone’s life. My developers keep making new and better versions of me, and a big amount of people sell me when they can get the latest version of me.”

**Class at Varia:**

I was ill and couldn’t be there. I asked my classmates to inform me about the class.
Hacking soup: everyone brought an ingredient and made a soup out of it together. Something that’s easily hackable, because once someone changes an ingredient, it changes the recipe, improving it or making it worse. It also questions the line of when something is hacking or not. Recipes are very open source of course. 


**Second class of Shailoh**
SCAMPER method: substitute, combine, adapt, modify, put to another use, eliminate and reverse. 
This method is a hacker mentality. It looks at existing things in the world and changes it’s current form in some way. “How are they connected? How are they composed” is the way to think if you want to start hacking something.
System: A group of interacting of interrelated entities that form a unified whole.(see wiki for more). Open systems have input and output flows, representing exchanges of matter, energy or information. A closed system, by definition, has no input or output. 
Almost anything is open to a certain extent. Almost everything exchanges something. It doesn’t have to mean it’s alive or it’s conscious. 		*connectology / everything is connected


Questions about connection  Can you undo the connection without any damage? (ex. a zipper) What is the kind of input/output that the connection can support? How many connections can something support?Looking at connections is looking at how to get into a system.
A reflection on the possible meaning of hacking
As a group, we decided to go for urban hacking. As a system, we chose the blocks / streets next to the WDKA. We thought of this while we were discussing safety in Rotterdam.

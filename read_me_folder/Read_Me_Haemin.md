## Observational tool
 
In this observational tool exercise, we were instructed to think of an inspection tool which was to be physically brought to class. In my case, the inspection tool was Post It notes. Initially we have to observe and look at the tools. Here I found it difficult not to analyze what the inspection tool was actually used for. After looking at the inspection tool, we had to physically touch the inspection tool. It was odd because despite the fact that I always bring Post Its with me for quick memos, when I was observing and touching the Post It, I was able to think of many different usage of Post Its which I did not think of before. Normally, I use Post Its to make memos and stick on my desk so that I do not forget. It is a costless method to catch my eyes so I do not forget things I noted. The exercise continued where I wrote 1) in which context the chosen inspection tool is used and 2) what the words would be had my inspection tool had its own voice.

***Reminiscent of:***  
*Memory, archive, analog, colourful, sticky*  
<br>
I thought of many different usages of Post Its. Firstly, reflecting on Post Its’ bright colours which catch the attention of the eyes, I thought it could be well suited for a bookmark. I can write important elements or why I have bookmarked a certain page with Post Its which will let me revisit this page later. Secondly, utilizing the stickiness of Post Its as well as it’s small size, Post Its can be used to clean places with narrow entrance. For example, it can prolong the life of one’s keyboard because Post Its can be used to clean spaces between keys on keyboards. Finally, given the various colours, and it’s ability to be written on and to stick, I thought that it can be used to be stuck onto walls in mass quantity for decoration. In my study room, I can stick post its with my memos onto walls and this way I can cherish memories, decorate the room, and as well as using the memo functionality of Post Its.

A Hacker’s Perspective on Cyber Security  
Social Hacking, Revisited

<br>

## Class: Shailoh and Joana  

The first class of Shailoh and Joana was quite introductory. Shailoh and Joana introduced themselves whilst we also introduced ourselves and which major we are studying. We discussed what does hacking mean to me. From my personal South Korean background, there is a negative connotation related to hacking. The public view them as criminals and they are only limited to activities within IT. This was what hacking had originally meant to me. However, I learnt that there are different kinds of hacking in this class. There are hacking that heavily intervenes with society creating big impacts. At the same time there are hackings that aim to simplify day to day life. In a following class, we also learnt the acronym Scamper. With more research I discovered that this was first proposed by Alex Faickney Osborn and further developed by Bob Eberle. As an activity based thinking process it shows a way to think outside the common system. In hacking terms it indicates a system where the components are linked. It stands for:

## Class: Florian Cramer  

 
The lecture with Florian Cramer was the one of the first initial steps to widening my outlook on the concept of hacking together with Shailoh and Joana’s first lecture. His class was mostly about the historical overview of how hacking evolved over time as well as explaining the basic foundation of the what hacking is. He also gave examples of various hacks over the course of history and this real life example helped me understand hacking better. I also learnt some important figures or groups of hackers starting from Tech Model Railway Club, to John Draper, to Abbie Hoffman. At first, it was difficult to follow Florian’s lecture because my initial conceptualized definition of hacking was a cybercrime that is caused by manipulating the IT system. However, in Florian’s lecture, I discovered that hacking be more than just digital. Hacking can infer to understanding the depths of a certain system and once one is familiar with the system, one can experiment and stretch their actions in an unforeseen way to the creator of the system as well as those in the system. In simple terms, it is about playing with the system and from this doing something very unspontaneous. When I found out that there was a smaller community of hackers and there was even a glossary of slangs for hackers (the Jargon file), I was quite surprised. Also the Cap’n Crunch (John Draper) example really shocked me. I would have not imagined that such a big telecom system can be outsmarted by an individual with a toy. Another interesting topic that stemmed from Florian’s lecture which I researched more on was the differentiation between good hackers known as white hat hackers and bad hackers known as black hat hackers. Hence, this lecture completely disproved my initial understanding of hacking as being bad and only related with IT.

 ## Class: Varia  
 
An interesting experience at Varia where we physically attempted a hack. The hack was aimed at a recipe of a soup. Based on the different ingredients that we brought to class, we attempted to think of a way how each individual ingredients can contribute to a part of the soup. The first attempt was to disregard any recipe or knowledge on soups and make a soup with all the ingredients combined. The second attempt was to follow a recipe of a soup. Naturally, we were not given the recipe in advance and our prepared ingredients differed from the required ingredients in the recipe. However, I felt that this was more accurate representation of hacking we see or we will see in our world. A creative, efficient and most importantly a different perspective to a solution whilst staying within boundaries of the set of systems. Not only did this exercise teach me a thing or two about cooking but it also gave me a valuable first-hand experience to work with what I currently have whilst following a set of guidelines.

## Revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of ‘Hacking’
 
Before this practice, my interpretation of hacking was purely the act of committing a cybercrime by disrupting data and algorithm via computer. However, this was a shallow knowledge and over the course of this practice, I had developed new ideas on the meaning of hacking. Sub-consciously I sometimes still relate hacking with cyber security and with technology. However, I realized throughout the course of this course, as long the hacker can develop an idea that can penetrate and infiltrate a system after thorough analysis I also feel that the concept hacking can be applied to elsewhere such as socially, economically, and culturally.

<br>
The lecture of Florian Cramer had been the starting point where I became more familiar with the concept of white hat hacking. I began to understand that the term hacking is not only used for negative purposes but instead, it was more about a different perception to the conventional things. The observation tool class had taught me apply the hacking concept to an item. Here I developed my hacking method which is to first understand the current role and function of an item that you should to hack with. Only once I have properly analyzed and understood the ability of the item and how it is currently used, I will be able to find a different application to this item.
 <br>
<br>
The exercise performed in Varia has taught me that understanding the system is even more important for hacking. Here the context was hack a soup recipe with the ingredients that I had, where the ingredients that I have and in the recipe differs. To understand what is needed, to identify what is missing, and to coming up with a solution to the missing link was my approach. If the recipe represents the system, I had to analyze the functions of the different ingredients which could be replace the missing ingredients to that in the recipe. As such throughout this course I saw and learnt about applications which were not considered as intentional by the network or system architecture.

From my experiences during this practice allowed me to open my vision on the possibilities of an artist. Before I had experienced this class, my classes in Lifestyle Design Transformation often put heavy emphasis on creativity and thinking outside the box. However, I had often understood this phrase to develop a disruptive brand new idea that is outside the boundaries of a system. During this practice, I developed the understanding to be creative whilst staying within the system or network. Finding an unconventional way to solve a problem is what I think hacking truly means.

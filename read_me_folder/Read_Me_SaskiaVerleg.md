# HACKING

_Even testen_**

____

###### DOCUMENTATION Shailoh and Joanna

The first class was about what hacking means for you (as designer). I'm a Lifestyle Transformation Design student and i'm allawys busy with the people around me and how they move in the society. My focus is on digital media and how the behavior of the people has changed due the internet and all the screens. I like to make a statement with my products/ designs to make people think about their behavior. Most of the time i show it in a future scenario. I think for me hacking is to change products and 'normal' enviroment to something else. To change the context, so people notice it and remind them of what they do and how + why they do it. To make them aware. 

**What is hacking?** 
different kind of hacking

- urban hacking : **intervention, critical on society, make impact, play with context**
- lifestyle hacking : **Make life easier, change patterns, change systems**
- product hacking : **change products, use products in different way, combine materials, adjust, let go of the standard** 

to hack you have to learn about the system before you break in the system.

scamper: behavior movement . structured way to think out of the box 

**S** substitute, comes up with another topic that is equivalent to the present topic.
**C** combine, adds information to the original topic.
**A** adapt, identifies ways to construct the topic in a more flexible and adjusted material.
**M** modify, creatively changes the topic or makes a feature/idea bigger or smaller.
**P** put to another use, identifies the possible scenarios and situations where this topic can be used.
**E** eliminate, removes ideas or elements from the topic that are not valuable.
**R** reverse,  rearrange evolves a new concept from the original concept. 

something already present in world that u has hacker didn’t put there. Things full of things that are now in a way that doesn’t make sense anymore. maybe did before? 

**what is a  system?**
- group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole. surrounded by environment. 
- close system has no input and no output. But everything is part of system, things exchange. 

examples: sub system: metro 
1. people 
2. metro 
3. incheck point 

focus chairs in metro: 
1. bouten
2. schroeven
3. fabric
4. plastic 

**Everything is connected**
7 degrees of separation: een theorie die stelt dat eenieder op onze planeet, door een netwerk met zes tussenstappen of vijf tussenpersonen, met elkaar verbonden is. 

Globalisation, market, internet. 
question : can u undo the connection without any damage? 

example: fabric with zipper u can stretch it apart without any damage. Without zipper the fabric will be damaged. U CAN put it back together but never will be a s it started. 
what is the input and output that the connection support? 
connection can be transportation system to go from 1 place to another. 
How many connection can support. Look at quality, how is something made up? how easy is it to break it open? 
focus connection: looking at connection is looking in to the system. start looking to the world in a different way. 

**MAKE YOUR HACK**   

whith this exercise we had to make our own hack, catorgized in 4 themes: social, organic, mechanical and electric. I went in the city and to the albertheijn. In the beginning it was hard for me to find these things and to hack it in a way. After a while I found out that you can just hack it with a small adjustment. We looked to the fire escape in the academy and saw that if you just put a new piece of paper in it or draw over it, you can hack the way people would walk when there is a fire. 

### REFLECTION PARAGRAPH ON THE OBSERVATIONAL TOOL EXERCISES

We had to bring an inspection tool. I choose for a scissor because I use a scissor a lot to cut out images i like. We had to feel the object with our eyes closed and en look to the object in different perspectives. This excersize was hard for me, i still looked at it as a scissor. 

**We had to write down in whitch context the object could be used and how you can use it as an inspection tool. I didn't understand the assignment very well. My inspection** (dutch): 
*scherp aan ene kant, zacht en bol aan andere kant. 2 materialen, bedoeld om dingen los van elkaar te halen, werkt alleen dmv interactief bezig te zijn, doet uit zichzelf niks, scheiden, 2 kleuren, 2 materialen, 2 losse onderdelen, knippen, loshalen, bevrijden, interactie, plek voor hand / vingers, rechtshandig?, snijden, snel te gebruiken, geen gebruiksaanwijzing, handig, licht van gewicht, te bewegen, open en dicht, 2 tegenpolen in 1 object, uit elkaar te halen, te verstellen, diverse maten, te gebruiken om iets los te halen, iets open te maken, iets te verwijderen.*

**Then we had to write down what it would like if the object would have it's own language** 
*ik ben een schaar, ik ben scherp, handig, nodig. Ik ben licht van gewicht maar vanwege mijn hefboom effect kan ik meer door knippen dan je denkt, ik besta uit 2 materialen, ik  ben 2 tegenpolen in 1 object: scherp en koud aan de ene kant, bol en rond aan de andere kant, ik wil je geen pijn doen maar je moet me wel goed gebruiken, ik ben makkelijk te bedienen. Als je denkt dat je teveel kracht moet zetten me te gebruiken, blijf dan niet duwen: ik zal breken. Ik ben te verstellen mocht dit nodig zijn, ik ben vriendelijk voor je handen. Zal mijn best doen zo scherp mogelijk te zijn, ik kom voor in kleurtjes en maten: voor ieder wat wils. ik ben er voor jou om dingen van elkaar te scheiden.*

After this assignment we had to switch our item. I got an passer and did the assignment again. It was hard to do this assignment becuase i couldn't really put the itemt out of its context.

#### CLASS JOSEPH 

We had to bring a piece of fruit and 11 parts of your body (scanned, A3 format). At first Joseph showed us a dia show in which he showed us some hacking things he liked. After that we had to make our own hack in pairs, in 20 minutes. I went downstairs and rigth away was thinking about what i could hack. I thought about some struggles i had in school, this was my starting point. After this me and my teammate coudn't really think of a big problem we could solve so we made a 'hack' with the water machine. In some kinda funny way we managed to get a drink with 2 people instead of 1. 

*for me this assignment was fun. There weren't any rules so you could do anything. This exercise made me realise that with just a small adjustment you can hack allmost everything. The 'hack' doesn't have to be so intens and big to make impact and change the system your working in. you also just have to start, don't think just do it.*

After this we had to re-created our body again. I started to cut and came out with a new body.

### LECTURE FLORIAN CRAMER  

Florian showed us more examples of hacking and told us about old hacks from years ago. One example was John Draper (Captain Crunch / Crunch or Crunchman) He is an american computer programmer and former of the legendary phone phreak. He managed to make free phone calls with a toy. 

Hacking is about playing with systems and to do something unexpected with it. Florian showed a few examples from the past and for me it became really clear that hacking is really broad. I can be like a small detail and little adjustment. An example was the book with the title 'steal this book' by Abbie Hoffman. This showed for me that also in commercial ways you can use nice hacks to sell your prodcut or to tell your message.

### class 27 mei (ziek) - VARIA 
I wasn't in this class but i asked some people and they told me they had to hack a soup by putting in different ingredients. these ingriedients were things you normally don't put together. With this you change or hack the recepy. But where is the line with hacking? Is changing ingredients also hacking? For me it isn't because i think hacking also has to have a kind of message or meaning. 

hacking soup, change ingredients. 
where is the line of hacking? : depends on context. 
pushing boundary, not crossing

### GROUP PROJECT 

**MEETING 1**

Samen video gekeken over artikel 13. Wat is het, wat zijn de gevolgen en hoe is het op stand gekomen? Erna bespreking wat wij willen. Hoe en welke aanpassingen daarvoor nodig? idee nog te groot, hoe verkleinen? en TESTEN? 

artikel 13: focus memes. Zelf filter maken om te testen hoe het werkt? probleem: nog geen bestaand systeem.. Hoe past binnen opdracht? Oplossing misschien bestaande memes door programma heen gooien die het vergelijkt met bestanden die hij wel kent en zelf beeld met die bestaanden beelden maakt. Zelf memes maken? Analoog?? 'zo gaan memes er uit zien?', Interview regelen met iemand die verstand heeft van ae systeem? vanuit daar eigen systeem maken wat er op lijkt.  

Na eind van meeting toch niet zeker van idee. Persoon die we wilde contacten voor informatie niet aanwezig op academie. Verder gebrainstormd : wat vinden we lastig in aller daags leven? waar ergeren we ons aan? Welk systeem kunnen we veranderen? 

Met groep diverse ideen bedacht. Uiteindelijk gekozen om het smokkelen van drugs te hacken. Tegenwoordig worden veel drugs gebruikt en naar binnengesmokkeld tijdens het uitgaan en festivals. Deze worden op diverse manieren verstopt zodat bewaking niet achter komt dat je het bij hebt. Wat als we nu juist open en bloot onze drugs bij ons houden? Zouden we dan nog binnenkomen? Idee: drugs dragen als sierraden. TESTEN! 

**MEETING 2**

some people made allready designes. We discusses what the best way of bringing your drugs to a festival can be. At first the idea was to made really jewelery and 'hide' the drugs in there but that wasn't our goal and then it wouln't be a hack. So we decide to make the drugs jewelery as visible as possible. We went to the shops to get a jewerelry kit and then we discussed how we could test it and where. On thursday there was a party in Now&Wow so 4 of us bought a ticket. 

Bacause we didn't want to do any illigal we bought multivitamine pills and paracetamol. These pills looked like real xtc pills. 

**MEETING 3** 
2 of us made the jewelery and later in the evening we went out to Now&Wow. 2 of us wore the neckalaces, armlaces and earrings, the other 2 were filming and document the test. It wasn't busy at all and it went really fast. I had a small chat with one guards because and even after the this he didn't noticed the drugs on me. 

It was hard to film and make photos because of the dark and also because there where no other people at the door so it would be to obvious. When we were inside some people noticed the drugs and some didn't. Most of the people didn't saw it or didn't say anything.

**MEETING 4**
Now we had to go to the next step. How are we going to show our hack and how to improve the jewelery? We now know that you CAN smuggle drugs into a festival when you wear it really exposed. How to send this message? How to present and how can we send our message? 

We decided to make a video of our test in combination with a  closeups of the jewelery. We split our group in teams. 2 thought about how to make the video, 2 were making the jewelery ready for the shoot and 1 was doing the voice over. It all went really well and everybody was continuously showing what they had found / did so we could give feedback on it. 

Our end result :

**MEETING 5** 
We started at 8:30 and made as many shots as possible. Because I was the model I couldn't really see what was going on so most of the time i just listened to what my teammates told me to do. I went really wel! and it was nice to see our end result on a body.

### REFELCTION 

At the beginning of this practice I had no idea what hacking was. After the first lesson i started to think what hacking means for me and looked into my own projects and found out that i allready did hack al lot with my interventions and products. This was fun to see. I like to change an enviroment and with this to tell your story. The story doesn't have to be so clear for me, what I like is to let people think for themself and interpret it on their own way. 

For the group project it was nice to test it in real life. We never could have done this without testing and i learned that testing is a big part with in hacking. With testing you get to know your adience and can play with this. I would like to test it more and even to test it with real drugs but i know this is not aloud within the academy.

With our hack we show our critic on the system. We didn't hide our stuff and still nobody saw it, even after an security check. Nobody would expect that you wear an illigal drug this exposed. We did the opposite of what you normally do when you do something illigal and in this way we hacked the security. The jewellery has to be easy for use, hold your drug and you have to take the pill of easilly. With these things in mind we came with the idea of small clips. with this you can easilly put your pill in a clip and take it out and put it back again. This was our starting point and then we made some test with it, to see what worked and what didn't. At first I wanted it to look pretty but after an hour in the metal station, when i still didn't made any progress I remembered that it isn't about the product itself but about the hack. So then i focused more on the function and how to wear it then how it looked. 

The extra hack is that the this hack it's just only a way to smoggle your drugs into a festival, but you can even use your drugs it in a hidden way. Normally people have to take their drugs in the toilet or have to hide themself. With the jewelery you can easy take your pill at the dance floor and nobody wil notice. If more people would use this hack, to smoggle in drugs, I it's not allowed to wear jewelery to fesivals in the future. I think every 'hack' in the illigal world is just temporary, but it's funny to see that people are really creative when it comes to bypassing rules.  

In the beginning it was hard for me to do the exercises. Especially the exercises in class where difficult. I couldn't focus and didn't saw the purpose of it. After a while i found out that you really have to put the product or system out of it context to change its context. You have to know the routine and system, otherwise you can't break in. I notice I look different to normal systems now and this is a nice new tool I hope to use more in my future projects.

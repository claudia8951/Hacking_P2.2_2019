#### 2. Observational tool exercise##

Description of my object (a book)  from different points of views.
Affordances:
The book is a container for sharing knowledge.
Can be (must be) opened in order to access its knowledge : you need to know how to read, how to speak the language, understand the codes of the author’s intentions.
As an introspection tool, it is a way to gain insights and learn about a certain topic, for which you can find yourself to be passionate about, or thanks to which you now understand better. 
Almost anyone can write in a book, and get it published online thanks to these very open publishing places : The notion of trust for this information or the publisher has to be taken into account, and there could be a problem of misinformation or manipulation. 
Exchanged for money most of the time. It’s a trade, capital not only traded for knowledge but also for a specific opinion on the subject.

From the object’s own point of view.
The journey. Someone wrote words on paper. Then on a computer. I was made pdfs from, sent through email and printed, and sent by the post. People who later on read me decided to print me more, and write their names on me. They made ink from my words, and put a cover all around me. My words now resound forever. I was sent to stored, warehouses, websites, book shops all over the world. People pay money to have me. I was also translated to other languages so that more people could understand me. I’ve seen many faces. People who liked me told me I helped they understand better. Some people added their own words next to mine. Sometimes people write about me, and will convince others to read me. 

Reflection.
For the first part, observing the object was more about understanding and looking at the cover and outside of the book, and how this reflects on what’s written in it. The purpose of the object and the affordances and introspection tool are in what’s inside, when you read it. So, the first look and quick observation has to be about its outside and what would enhance the fact that people would want to interact with the object and its affordances, which is - now I realize - a very graphic designer’s thing to do. Of course my job would be to present and communicate these affordances in such a way.
However, the second exercise was written from the content of the book’s point of view itself. The information and its history/process of how it becomes the physical book I’m holding, but not only how the information “floats” from the first person to write it towards the readers.

#### 4. Thoughts on classes##

*Anatomy* and the context of hacking : exploring by disrupting and going inside a system. 
Inspecting and intervening is about observing. Seeing, looking, watching (getting an opinion, a certain point of view).
**Affordance** (Don Norman) : what you see that you can do… : Design and web design’s  purpose is to make expected actions clear to the user, and this is where the hackers will look further into. Reaction with control. The hacker’s purpose is to regain this control from “being designed” or being told what to do and how by the design. 
Interface : Means “in-between”, a medium by which something is communicated. They are being designed as such.
“Media VS Interface” (MArshall McLuhan) : Interface as the action or platform containing actions and other interfaces : Closer to the anatomy, more and more systems within the body.
Categorization : Inspecting what is found by anatomy but also in other contexts like coding and data mining. Classification is a big part of data analysis. 

This also made me think of an artistic hack example by Joan Fontcuberta’s : [The fake animal archive exhibition](http://juanmagonzalez.com/fontcuberta/fauna.html). Joan Fontcuberta is an artist that made this exhibition together with a photographer, by faking photographs/montages/taxidermy…. into creating a fake archive of a scientist researcher that had found these surreal creatures.
People who went to the exhibition had to believe these archives were true, because of the context they were presented in.
Now, with photoshop/internet it is much easier to fake something and present it as legitimate. Fake news spread fast and enough “social experiments” have proven that people will believe what you write in a published article online. Which makes some people also more skeptical about that. Maybe these people will want to rely on other sources such as newspapers, TV or museums to inform themselves of what happens in the world.
How can we hack a fairly trusted source into spreading fake information similarly to Joan Fontcuberta in a playful way and a topic that wouldn’t have “dangerous” consequences (a topic that went dangerously far based on fake news are vaccines causing the anti-vax movement for example).
Similarly to Joan Fontcuberta we could create a fictional object/discovery, document it as a strange finding in a specific context and present it as such to a larger audience that would be inclined to trust its authenticity.



#### 5. Florian Cramer##

The history of hacking. What were the first “hacks”, where does it come from?
First example of a hack was the cereal toy whistle that turned out to be a hack for **tricking** phone lines into getting free communication time. This started the sub-culture with also magazines like 2600 or YIOL.
An example of hack in the Academy would be the Food Factory, which was created as a response to the already existing cafeteria **system**. Calling themselves a “station” is a way to legitimize themselves to deviate the “power” of the Academy institution that could kick them out otherwise. It’s a **solution** and an **alternative** to the cafeteria and the people who criticized it. This shines a light on the **limitations** and the **parameters** of the system and how it is responded to. 
About the hacker’s attitude. The hacker does not stop at the limitations of a system. He sees it, he investigates it, and responds to it. Nothing is impossible. There’s a solution or an alternative to everything. The process of a hacker is to search the limitations and stretch its abilities.
“Hackers” doesn’t stop at the digital or programming fields, it can refer to any enthusiasm of any field, for which the term “**geek**” is now attributed to. The hacker, or geek enjoys creatively overcoming the limitations that he faces. There is a part of maliciousness in trying to discover sensitive information by “poking around”. 
Torrent websites or hacking in general is also about **open access**. The thought that free information is necessary, and the urge to make it possible. “Home taping is killing music… and it’s illegal” was turned around, hacked, and turned into the symbol for online pirates, especially the torrents platform Piratebay.
(Online resources. Ubuweb : Archive for artistic references, ebooks, audio, etc… Monoskop : Digital and media library, artists publishing, etc… Karagarga : Obscure movies or videos from artists or lesser known film makers.)
Open access and making things public is basically the job of librarians and raises the question of how justifiable is it in the context of the Academy or any other educational system. Is it legitimate to incite hacking and sharing illegally for educational purposes ? There is a certain point which is acceptable in certain contexts, and laws must be very precise about it. 
Cornellia’s Sollfrank’s example of how to **subvert** and reveal the limitations and blind spots of a specific system through a simple action of throwing a device on the ground expecting reactions from the system she is criticizing.
(Source : Yes Men)
Internal profiling : Albert Heijn and their six-categories profiles which determines the overall information that can be gathered from a certain profile, according to the part of the city they live in mostly. Data mining and classification systems can also be a **flaw/weakness** because it is somehow accessible and could be used for malicious purpose. People hacking into these data bases or into important information can do a lot of damage to the system responsible. 
Hacking systems are also used by the police and the governments sometimes : the government worker paying a visit to newborn’s families in order to make sure that the baby actually exists. This was to overcome the movement of importations from Eastern Europe.

This raises many questions, such as can anything be hackable ? 
Can hacking be legitimized ? What are the limitations of hacking ?



#### 6. Varia

I unfortunately missed the class at Varia, but we started investigating the fashion industry as a possible system during this event. I started making research about it while the class was happening.


#### 7. Reflection on hacking, context, system investigated, what did we find, what method, limitations of the tool.

We chose to investigate a system that is somewhat close to us, but at the same time that we are not completely familiar with and have our criticism for. The fashion industry today and big brands such as Supreme or Gucci seem to already be a “dérive” of their own industry, with how they made fashion be about something else, something more than just clothing. Supreme has created such an incredible hype around products they managed to merchandise, such as a clay brick, [selling for thousands of dollars on Ebay after selling out](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/30/red-clay-brick-selling-for-up-to-1000-on-ebay). You can also buy a Supreme hammer, a canoe or a fire extinguisher for hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars. In a way, I can see similarities between brands like Supreme and Gucci in how they have built such a huge reputation and public for their products, that at this point they know that pretty much anything they will produce will be praised, bought and probably sold out for most of it. There is this relationship of trust and power between the company and their public that makes anything possible for them. I already saw them as these self-aware “fashion prankers”, because of how ridiculous their items get sometimes. We made more research into brands such as Gucci and what is the extent of their “power”, which translates to how ridiculous can the items get for them to not be sold at all. Browsing through their website, it amazes me that single pieces of clothing can reach such a pricing, and makes me wonder about what it really takes to get to this level. I am absolutely sure that if a piece of clothing would be stripped off the “Gucci” label, it would be worth absolutely nothing. The context in which these items were presented is what gives it its value. The same goes for a lot of brands or fields, but we decided to focus on the fashion industry, and started wondering about what it would take for one piece of clothing to get the same level of attention than these legitimate brands’.
How can we create a highly valued object by imitating the system and therefore infiltrating it ? We decided to investigate one of these top brands, Balenciaga, and pick a specific item to base our hack on. We searched the different items that constitute the brand’s name and reputation. This is where we build context for our product. We inspect the codes of this industry and remake/reinvent them into our own purpose. 
What codes and what methods are used by these designers which give these sneakers the looks of a 800$ sneakers ? What makes it so valuable in the end ? 
**Would imitating these assets be enough for a cheap shoe to be as valuable ?**
We bought a 19 euros pair of white sneakers and applied what we observed on the high-priced shoes to them. This combined with the aesthetics of the communication and advertisement campaigns of the brand, we achieved to “infiltrate” the system we investigated and make our object valuable for what it’s not. Making the sneakers brought a lot of insights about the brands we looked into, and helped understand (but not comprehend) why they are so valued in the eyes of the customers.

###  What is hacking?
First thing I thought about what a hacker actually was, someone who uses a computer system to get acces to a different system or make the system unavailable. Those hacker had a goal, bring down a system, stealing money, making the network unavailable or destroying it.

There are 2 types of hackers and each type of the hacker hacks for a different reason: **the black hat hacker** is basically a hacker who hack for evil and without permission, **the white hat hacker** who is against evil (the black hat hacker) and protects the computer, network with permission and **the grey hat hacker** is a hacker who is in the middel of this, neither good or bad they are neutral.

### Manifesto Edition:
- The Mentor : (Explorer) he makes use of a service that’s already existing, without paying. He’s is saying that he’ve been called a criminal but his crime would be his curiosity and outsmarting people. Someone who is angry about the tech see how all of these are connected.

*Blue Hat Hacker: motivated on revenge
Manipulation: the process of skilfully handling, controlling, or using something*

- Manifestation : This hacker is tending to be different or develop in different things/ directions

*Grey Hat Hacker: Hacking for self - neutral*

- We Are FemTechNet : definitely a network, a group who has more devices that can communicate. They are working towards social change by combining programming skills with critical thinking.

*Yellow Hat Hackers : Hactivists
Hactivists: (individuals who perform hacktivism) act of misusing a computer system or network for a socially or politically motivated reason.*

- The Critical Engineering Manifesto : Expanding into social and psychological realms, regulating behaviour between people and the machines they interact with. (reconstruct user-constraints and social action through means of digital excavation)

*White hat hacker : using their skills/knowledge to improve, hacking for a greater good*

- The Xenofeminist Manifesto : They say that they are adamantly synthetic, unsatisfied by analysis alone. They develop an ideological infrastructure that both supports and facilitates feminist interventions within connective, networked elements of the contemporary world. 

*Invent : create or design (something that has not existed before); be the originator of*

### Observation Tool:
I had my iPhone which can be used as a tool for communication with others and in the social media. It has a lot of information on it so a tiny flat rectangle with lots of data. I can get acces to information, document and inspect by making pictures , videos and also record sound. Because it has everything on it I can’t live without it so the phone is useably when I use it. 

**Reflection** : I didn’t felt much because everything you want to know is inside of it, I mean I knew where everything was like the buttons and the plug extension because I am so used to it but when you don’t know and you have your eyes closed its quite interesting. I think it because more personal when you closed your eyes, and also I was amazed by how heavy my phone actually was. 

**iPhone feelings** : Hi my name is “iPhone van Beyza” I’m the model XR pretty different than the others not only by my name but my body is red! I have acces to soooo many information it’s unbelievable you have to feed me though with some energy other wise I won’t work for her all day just saying. Also I see everything through my one eye in the back and front so I can inspect so many things. I will always collect data but at some point I will get full of eating to much of it so be aware not to much ok. When she doesn’t use me I feel cold and useless, but when she does I feel her warmth and connection but sometimes too much warmth is not good. That means she has to take a break and give me one also because of overusing me. But still love and she love me 100%.

### Hacking Glossery:
- Corrupt: performance of illegal acts for personal gain, without apology
- Adjusting: to change something slightly to make it more correct, effective or suitable
- Invading : to enter a place by force, often in large numbers
- Freedom fighter: a person who takes part in revolutionary struggle to achieve a political goal
- Integrate: combine and make it one
- Deviation: something that’s different from what people consider to be normal or acceptable
- Unconventional : not based on or conforming to what is generally done or believed

### Documentation:
When I came to the first lesson I still had no clue what they meant with “hacking” actually I had but that was a literally meaning of hacking. Its was interesting when Shailoh asked about what our hack was, and most of the answers were different then I thought it would be, for instance body parts or feelings. Some of the answers to that question were mostly about coding which I had also in mind. After the lectures/presentations it was a bit clearer what they meant with hacking, that you actually don’t have to dive into the technical part, it could be anything else as long as you flip the thought.  

**Shailoh** : This lesson was interesting!, we saw how things were connected, held together and how the system actually works. And also when something was a hack and when it was a system on its’s own. Me and Robbin made several boomerangs at school but the one that stood us apart was the faucet in the toilets. Because the aerator limits the water flow through the faucet, water use is reduced as compared to the same time of flow without an aerator. What if you would hack this system.

-system definition (wikipedia diagram)
-microchip system - open system you don’t know what goes in or either out
-closed system has no input or output
-coffee machine - outdoor system by paying 
-a system has other systems inside it that connects with other systems
-everything is connected 
-within 7 degrees with yourself you can connect to everyone
-can you undo the connection without tearing it apart (zipper, fabric, marriage)
-what is the QUALITY of connection (one place to another example coffee machine) 
-What kind of connection is it (social, mechanical, electrical)

Dividing connection: Trains - the connection between Schiedam and Rotterdam (tree connection)

Social : language, social, promise
Organic: cells, membrane, veins, metabolism
Mechanical: screws, nails, hooks, rope knots, glue, tape
Electric:  cables, bluetooth, wifi
Waves: sound, light,
Spatial 

Sigaret connection: regenerative connection with the body

**Joseph** : This class was so confusing, we took the pictures so we were prepared anyways I didn’t know what to expect but we were asked to hack our bodies by cutting them in pieces and adding other elements to it. This was very nice to start with because in that week I still didn’t know what “hacking” meant so this class helped a lot. What we did I grouped with another classmate and we combined our bodies together and made it one (intergrate), because that’s what hacking was for us. This is what I also got from his class : hacking is an attitude, its a way of seeing the world differently, in a way of interpreting a relation he relation between things, the difference between looking, observing and thinking.

### Florian Cramer:
His lecture was about the history of hacking, this was very interesting and also useful he gave us some interesting sources where we could get acces to things and also that there were many different movements attached to the system of hacking. I think also what I got from his lecture was that we shouldn’t stick to the standards but change the destination/outcome.

### Varia:
We had an introduction first with Niek, we introduces our ingredients to him on the ‘why’ part. And then he explained more about hacking the food and showed us some references. This class gave me more insight about hacking, because in the first class it was more theoretical and trying to see it differently and in this class we actually made something that had more meaning. In this class we learned about being more aware with the ingredients that you are using to make something. 

Inspection tool: iPhone

Something to inspect: Pincet 

Ingredient: lime

### Reflection: 
First Idea: Finding specific buildings in Rotterdam and make it parasite (we are used to the old building standard building what if we can change is and hack the standards of the building) manipulate the system hacking : no tight rules but looser. 

Second Idea’s: 
Biohacking 1 : is a social movement where you study biology and life science using the same methods as traditional research, we could hack our body to have superpowers or becoming super humans but that unrealistic 

Biohacking 2 : we could bio hack our health for improving mental performances and energy for a more vibrant life

### Actual project:
With our project we wanted to hack the system of the area around school, we were interested about why we felt so uncomfortable walking at those dangerous place, what made it so dangerous. So we split the taks and everyone had their own research on the why, how and what part. What I found interesting about my research is about the graffiti that were at those dangerous places we could hack this system also because I think and truly believe that there is a connection between those 2 topics/ communities (graffiti & hackers). The roots of these 2 are the same like having the skills and freedom. One is real life and the other on the web.

After this we looked into how to hack the walking pattern of the people around those areas. Eventually we decided to make the surrounding/ the dangerous place less dangerous and safer. 

We first made a map by pointing out the place that we find scary around our school, and that was the place where they are building now next to the water because that path was so narrow and surrounded with construction. Imagine walking alone at night that would be really uncomfortable.  

Our hacking method would be that making the place less dangerous as possible by adding lights or other elements to the surrounding. We analysed the system and used it to change it.

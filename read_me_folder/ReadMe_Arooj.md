My observation tools were keys 
Keys
Performance quality/context: To open, unlock, lock, attach keyrings, to keep safe
Point of view from the key: “I’m your key , I come in forms, shapes and sizes, sometimes you lose me , sometimes you throw me , but please don’t forget me , I’m attached to all your keyrings , sometimes you can’t find me, among many keys I am the only one that can open your doors so don’t ever lose me.

4.	gather documentation on the two sessions with Shailoh and Joana;
(Anatomy of Connectologogy : how things are connected, investigate possible ways of modifying or intervening in existing systems.)
introduction to SCAMPER-Method

Substitute
Combine
Adjust
Modify, magnify
Put to other uses
Eliminate
Reverse

thinking of how to intevene into systems using this method, invetigating how the systems works and how to catergorize it .for expample an interactive screen is an electronic system and is omposed of glass screen electronics, wires, plastic,metal. it can also be seen as social as it communicates messages to people.


5.	write a summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer;
History of hacking,
Introduced to how hacking started and the history behind hackers.
 looking into the different meaning of what a hacker is.
Social hacking , hacking through advertisements, magazines and online.

6.	write a summary on the exercise you developed at Varia;
hacking recipes: create soup using ingredients that everyone bring. After discussion it was concluded that putting in every ingredient randomly would affect who can eat or not because of allergies and dietary requirements , therefore to make the soup cater for everyone’s needs we would need to hack the recipe, eliminating any allergies but the recipe cannot be fully hacked because people can be allergic to anything , the hack was successful to only an extent,
hacking the mind, choreography: (movement)
in groups observe objects or tools and define the choreography of the tool, how does it move what can it do.
     Observation of chair: to sit on  , lean on it, hang your coat or place your objects on it , use it as a ladder , table , turn it around and use as a drying rack.  


revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' What is the context in which you operated? What phygical systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method? 
In groups we decided to hack artwork using our senses and recreate it so the context we used was to intervene, inspect and manipulate. We inspected the system of private art collections. From our investigations we found that it was easy to manipulate private artwork because it was already available online for people to see, we took a piece of artwork and through hacking it using our senses we are able to recreate in sense copy the artwork by giving in a new place and are essentially hacking the system of private art collections.
If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);
The methods we used were inspecting and intervening through our senses.
To explain I would get them to investigate a system and use their senses to inspect and intervene in  the system which they have chosen , at first you would need to recognize the senses , smell , touch , taste , see and hear, then you would need to give each sense a form and manipulate the system into the sense you choose, the limits to this would be that not everyone is able to fully use all of their senses so It would be biased against people who cannot make use of their senses.
